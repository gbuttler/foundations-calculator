# foundations-calculator

1. I have created the basic calculator, and the buttons work. I now need to get the numbers to appear in the correct spans.

2. The numbers now appear in the correct spans, but I can only have one digit per number.

3. I figured out I needed to delete the a==0 in the if statement first line. 

4. I have managed to get all of the sums to work. But you do have to type in each individual sum

5. I have made the 'clear' button work by simply reloading the page.

6. I have made the calculator look nicer using CSS.

7. There is still an issue where if you try to ude a number with a decimal point it gives an incorrect result, not sure why. I may come back to this later when I have renewed energy for the project. 

NEXT STEPS
- If you press an operator after your first and second numbers have been entered, it automatically uses the result number as 'firstNumber'
- Allow you to use the result number as the number for your next sum, so you can do a long string of calculations. (simply by keying in another operator)
- Make the calculator look nice.
- round answers with long decimals
- Display a snarky message if you try to divide by zero
