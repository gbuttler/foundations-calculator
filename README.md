# foundations-calculator

1. I have created the basic calculator, and the buttons work. I now need to get the numbers to appear in the correct spans.

2. The numbers now appear in the correct spans, but I can only have one digit per number.

3. I figured out I needed to delete the a==0 in the if statement first line. 

4. I have managed to get all of the sums to work. But you do have to type in each individual sum

5. I have made the 'clear' button work by simply reloading the page.

NEXT STEPS
- Make the 'Clear' button work
- Allow you to use the result number as the number for your next sum.
- Make the calculator look nice.
